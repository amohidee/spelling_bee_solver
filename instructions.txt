1) Use the rrt.py and Custom_Objects.py included inthe zip instead of the default files in cozmo_tools.
2) Bring up a picture of one of the two spelling bees included in the zip, or use any spelling bee that uses a subset of these 13 letters: A, V, L, N, C, H, E, T, O, P, I, R, Y
3) Arrange the letter cubes in any order on the floor. Make sure they are spaced close to each other.
4) Put an Aruco wall behind the cubes and put an Aruco wall in front of the cubes, but at a much larger distance so there is space to place the Cozmo Robot.
5) Run Spelling.fsm and hold Cozmo's camera to the screen.
6) When Cozmo says to, put Cozmo in front of the cubes around one and a half tiles behind the cubes, directly behind the third cube from the left.
7) Observe Cozmo spell out the word!
